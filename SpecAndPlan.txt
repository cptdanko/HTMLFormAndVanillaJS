Spec and plan to build 

1) Build a user form that captures 3 values
    - name, salary (number) and age (date string)

2) Post the data to a REST endpoint
3) Include some front-end tests

Plan
A 2 stage approach,

1) Design this form using vanilla Javascript 
2) Design the same thing using Angular (should take less time)

Vanilla approach 

1) Create the html file index.html
    - include meta tags to resize the view
    - add 2 divs, one to store the form fields and one for buttons
    - add 3 input fields of type, text, number and datetime-local
    - add 2 buttons, one to submit form and one to reset the form

2) Create index.css file 
    - create a class form for form fields style it with Flexbox
    - add input fields CSS, add 
        - grey background, 
        - border-radius (5?)
        - border-bottom (1px)
    - add a class for buttons add 3d button effect with boxshadow

3) Create index.js file 
    - create a function to capture the form fields
    - a function to validate the values submitted
    - a function to submit the fields to the REST endpoint
    - define a constant that stores the REST endpoint
    - submit the form using XMLHttpRequest function 
        - think about this, should we use XMLHttpRequest or Fetch?
        - the only issue to consider is the browsers we need to support
    - now add a listener to disable submit button till truthy values
    - think about the functions we need to export for unit testing
    - export an object map of functions with module.exports for JEST

4) Turn this into a node project 
    - navigate to the project directory and run npm init
    - npm install jest --save (to add to the package.json file)
    - write the test
